# Roblox Open Cloud
A class based package for Roblox's Open Cloud API. Documentation coming in the future (hopefully)!
Some class names and methods are inspired by Roblox's Lua implementation (tho it's not exactly 1:1).

## Todo
Remaining Open Cloud endpoints to cover:
- [x] Datastore Service
- [x] Messaging Service
- [ ] Place Publishing
- [ ] OAuth Client
